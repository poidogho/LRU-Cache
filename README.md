# Introduction
**NOTE: Utilizing programming help tools like ChatGPT or Copilot, as well as installing additional packages, is strictly prohibited.**

The test is divided into three parts, project management, a refactoring part and a coding part. The tasks can be found within `TASKS.md`.
- The project management part is meant to test your ability to organize and plan work.
- The refactoring part is meant to test your ability to refactor code and apply clean code principles. 
- The coding part is meant to test your ability to write code and solve problems.

> Keep in mind acronyms such as SOLID, KISS, DRY and YAGNI.

# Commit Guidelines
Commit your code changes regularly, following the conventional commit format if possible. Ensure that each commit is atomic, containing a single coherent change. Write clear and descriptive commit messages.
